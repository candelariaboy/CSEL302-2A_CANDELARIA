**Data preprocessing:** in Google Colab refers to the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data to make it suitable for analysis or machine learning tasks within the Google Colaboratory environment. It involves various steps such as loading data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting data into training and testing sets. The goal of data preprocessing is to ensure that the data is in a format that can be effectively used for analysis or training machine learning models. Google Colab provides a convenient platform for performing these preprocessing tasks using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

**Importing libraries:** 

This is example of Import libraries

**- import pandas as pd**

**- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression**(These classes are used for linear regression and logistic regression, respectively, in machine learning tasks.)

**- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split**(This function is commonly used to split data into training and testing sets for machine learning model evaluation.)

**- from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix**(These functions are used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including mean squared error, R-squared score, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.)

**- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt**

**- import seaborn as sns**

**- import numpy as np**

**- data = pd.read_csv("Datasets.csv")**
*****
**Handling missing values:** 
This is example of Handling missing values
**- print(data.isnull().sum())**
*****
 **Encode Categorical Variables:** 
 This is example of Encode Categorical Variables
 
**data_dummies = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)**
**data_dummies['Monthly Revenue']=(data['data']>10).astype(int)**
*****
**Feature selection:** 
This is example of Future Selection 

**X = data_dummies.drop(['Monthly Revenue','Age'], axis=1)**
**y = data_dummies['Monthly Revenue']**
*****
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA:** refers to the process of visually and statistically exploring datasets to understand their main characteristics, detect patterns, identify anomalies, and formulate hypotheses. It involves examining the structure and content of the data using various statistical and visualization techniques.
*****
**Descriptive statistics:** 

This is example of Descriptive statistics
**-print(X.describe())**
*****
 **Visualizations:** 

 This is example of Visualizations
 **plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))**

**sns.histplot(data_dummies['Monthly Revenue'], bins=20, kde=True)**

**plt.title('Distribution of Monthly Revenue')**

**plt.xlabel('Monthly Revenue')**

**plt.ylabel('Count')**

**plt.show()**

**plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))**

**sns.histplot(data['Age'], bins=20, kde=True)**

**plt.title('Distribution of Age')**

**plt.xlabel('Age')**

**plt.ylabel('Count')**

**plt.show()**

  **Linear Regression Model:** for predicting monthly revenue involves using historical data on variables like monthly visitors and expenses to forecast future revenue. By establishing a linear relationship between these factors, the model calculates coefficients to minimize the disparity between predicted and actual revenue. Through this approach, businesses can gain insights into revenue trends, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions to enhance financial performance.

 **Build the Model**
  
This is example of Build the Model

  **X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)**

**lr_model = LinearRegression()**

**lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)**

**y_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test)**
*****


**Model Evaluation**

This is example of Model Evaluation

**mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)**

**rmse = np.sqrt(mse)**

**r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)**


**print("Linear Regression Model Evaluation:")**

**print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):", rmse)**

**print("R-squared (R2):", r2)**
*****

**Logistic regression:** is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of a binary outcome (such as success/failure, yes/no, 1/0) based on one or more predictor variables. The logistic regression model uses the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) to transform a linear combination of the predictor variables into a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the outcome belonging to one of the classes. This makes it suitable for problems where the dependent variable is categorical. It's widely used in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and social sciences.
